# Exercism
This repository contains my solutions to the Exercism exercises. They are intended for personal reference more than anything, but are made freely available here. Currently, I am primarily doing the Rust exercises, as I am becoming more familiar with the language. The solutions tend towards the naive, as my skills in Rust are still very much at a beginner level.

I also keep some links available here for easy access to relevant sites.
